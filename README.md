# Asteroid Rain

A very simple game made in Unity3D where asteroids rain from the sky, and it is the player's task to blow them up, by clicking (or tapping) on each asteroid.

Any asteroid that reaches the screen bottom will remove one life from the player. The game will end if the player has no more lives or when time runs out.

I once made this for a potential employer's programming test. I Decided to clean it up a bit and put it online as a sample.
